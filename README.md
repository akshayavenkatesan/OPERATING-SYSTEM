<h3>1.BANKERS ALGORITHM</h3>
<p>The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating 
the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an “s-state” check 
to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.</p>
